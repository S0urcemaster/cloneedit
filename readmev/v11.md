# V 0.11

- color changes
- localStorage : I have one working from DC2 that I reused once in DC3 . But first some cleanup and overall consolidation

Model changed : 
```
export type Clone = {
	id: number // unique id benÃ¶tigt pro Objekt
	name: string
	effect: Effect
}

export type Effect = {
	name: string
	sourceId?: number
	args: string[]
	update: (text: string, ...args: string[]) => string
}
```
We have each effect typed as line of text and several lines of it . So sourceId is child of Effect

- clean up constants : effects and factory documents in own directories, themes / all in static/ now

- localStorage adaptet

> backup / restore / reset from dc2

# V 0.11

- color changes
- localStorage : I have one working from DC2 that I reused once in DC3 . But first some cleanup and overall consolidation

Model changed : 
```
export type Clone = {
	id: number // unique id benÃ¶tigt pro Objekt
	name: string
	effect: Effect
}

export type Effect = {
	name: string
	sourceId?: number
	args: string[]
	update: (text: string, ...args: string[]) => string
}
```
We have each effect typed as line of text and several lines of it . So sourceId is child of Effect

- clean up constants : effects and factory documents in own directories, themes / all in static/ now

- localStorage adaptet

> backup / restore / reset from dc2
> lexical html serialization

> terms

It s better to make UI state initially undefined if you don t want the default state to blink up at app start . That means you have to check for undefined at the certain spots and else insert empty ''
```
export function CloneEditContextProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {

	const [state, setState] = useState<AppModel | undefined>()

	const {
		currentDocument,
		currentFolder,
		availableFolders,
		availableFiles,
		currentFile,
		folderChanged,
		fileChanged,
		setCurrentFile,
		setCurrentDocument,
	} = useFolderAndFileManagement(state)

	const [plainText, setPlainText] = useState('')

	const [settings, setSettings] = useState<Settings | undefined>(defaultState.settings)

	const [editorActions, setEditorActions] = useState<EditorAction[]>([])

	const [selectedClone, setSelectedClone] = useState<CloneModel | undefined>()
```
